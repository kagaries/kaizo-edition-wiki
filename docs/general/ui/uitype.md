# UIType

The **UIType** determines the layout of the UI during gameplay, and can be changed in the video settings. The **UIType** has 3 modes: 

- Default
- Mobile
- Compact

Default is what is normally used in Minecraft, and is the default when first launching the game.

Compact is a more compact version of the ui, having pretty much every thing on one side of the screen.
